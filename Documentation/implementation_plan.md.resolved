# Portfolio Layout Redesign

The goal is to redesign the portfolio's layout structure to be compact, recruiter-ready, and highly structured while maintaining the existing dark-themed Silicon Valley + terminal aesthetic.

## Proposed Changes

### Top / Hero Section
- **Reduce vertical space** between the name header and the subtitle.
- **Update subtitle** to: `AI Systems Engineer | B.Tech CSE (AI & ML) | SRM University, Chennai | CGPA: 9.44`.
- **Add positioning statement**: `Building AI-driven autonomous and simulation-based systems.` right below the subtitle.
- **Add buttons**: `[View Selected Work]` and `[Download Resume]` beneath the positioning statement.
- **Remove** the "Undergraduate Researcher" block from the hero section entirely.

### New & Updated Sections
- **About**: Update the text to be 3-4 concise lines focusing on AI/ML, RL, computer vision, and building reliable systems.
- **Experience**: Move the "Undergraduate Researcher" role here with resume-style bullet points.
- **Currently Building**: Add this new section listing 4 key focus areas (e.g., Simulation-based RL, Reward shaping).
- **Technical Focus**: Add this new section displaying key areas like RL, Autonomous Systems, Gen AI, Kernel Fundamentals as a grid of tags.
- **Selected Work**: Keep the project cards but update their content to consist of a 1-line problem statement, 2-3 bullet highlights, tech stack tags, and the GitHub button.
- **Core Technologies**: Reorganize the tech stack into categorized cards (Programming, AI/ML, Frameworks & Tools, Systems).
- **Achievements & Contact**: Unchanged content, but ensure alignment matches the new compact style.

### Media & Demos Tab
- **Implementation**: Introduce a simple React state `activeTab` ('home' | 'media') in [App.tsx](file:///s:/Myportfolio/src/App.tsx).
- **Tab Navigation**: Add a clean, terminal-styled sticky tab navigation at the top of the page (`[ ./home ] [ ./media_demos ]`).
- **Media View**: When 'media' is active, render a grid layout for showcasing project demo videos and screenshots.

### CSS Adjustments ([App.css](file:///s:/Myportfolio/src/App.css))
- Modify `.hero` to remove `min-height: 80vh` and use a tighter, content-fit layout with appropriate padding (`min-height: auto`, reduced padding).
- Adjust `.name-header`, `.header-subtitle` and paragraph margins to avoid large blank spaces.
- Create new styles for the Tab Navigation (`.tab-nav`, `.tab-btn`).
- Create styles for the "Technical Focus" tag grid (`.focus-grid`, `.focus-tag`).
- Adjust Project Card spacing to fit the new bulleted format cleanly.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- N/A (Frontend cosmetic and layout changes in an existing Vite app).

### Manual Verification
1. Run `npm run dev` and open the local preview.
2. Verify the Hero section is compact, name and subtitle are grouped together without huge gaps.
3. Check the spelling and text of the updated About, Experience, Currently Building, and Technical Focus sections.
4. Verify the Selected Work cards have exact problem statements, bullet highlights, and tech stack tags.
5. Click between the "Home" and "Media/Demos" tabs and ensure the view correctly conditionally renders.
6. Verify responsive behavior on mobile resolutions.
