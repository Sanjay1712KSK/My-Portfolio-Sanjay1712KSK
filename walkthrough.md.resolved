# Portfolio Website Walkthrough - V4 (Exact Copy Integration)

## Overview
I have finalized the layout to be completely compliant with your newest exact copy requirements while retaining the powerful, high-performance **Silicon Valley AI Startup / Terminal-inspired** aesthetic.

## Precise Copy Audits Completed:
- **Site Header**: `SANJAY KUMAR S` (bold, massive, at the top) followed immediately by the inline string `AI Systems Engineer | B.Tech CSE (AI & ML) | SRM University, Chennai | CGPA: 9.44`.
- **Hero Section**: 
  - The hero title correctly omits the initial description and focuses tightly on the subheading: `Undergraduate Researcher – SRM UROP Program`.
  - The short intro perfectly outlines your focus on ML, simulation, RL, autonomous navigation, and CV.
  - Buttons: `View Selected Work` and `Connect`.
- **About Section**: Text exactly reflects your academic program, your work in Unreal Engine 5 & Cosys AirSim, and your specific RL control policy implementations.
- **Experience**: The "Research & Engineering" section text and four bullet points precisely match your current UROP responsibilities.
- **Projects ("Selected Work")**: Every project card now explicitly contains the exact title, the provided description string, and crucially, an explicit `View on GitHub` button linking to the required repositories.
- **Contact ("connect")**:
  - `Email: sanjayksk1712@gmail.com`
  - `GitHub: https://github.com/Sanjay1712KSK`
  - `LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanjaykumarksk/`
  - The final text ("Open to research collaborations...") is included and followed by the `<span className="blinking-cursor"></span>`.

## Design Guarantees
- The dark theme (`#050505` to `#0a0a0c`), electric blue / neon cyan accents, and subtle glow effects remain active.
- Scroll observer fade-up reveals and staggered CSS delays are intact, ensuring zero heavy libraries affect loading speed.
- The startup-style grid layout of the Tech Stack continues to react vividly to hover states.

Everything looks exceptionally sharp, fast, and engineered for a top-tier AI lab aesthetic. You can view the live changes immediately on your running Vite server instance at `http://localhost:5173/`.
